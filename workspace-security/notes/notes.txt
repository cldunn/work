Broken authentication
	need to apply authorization to data layer in addition to service/controller
Session fixation
	attacker impersonates valid user by reusing previous generate session id
	eg. foregin form and posts action to server, if session id stored in cookie can inject script and exec in browser
Cross-site scripting (XSS)
	inject client-side script into page on server permitting others to run it when page accessed
	ie. need to sanitize request
Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
	extract url that calls action and run from outside application
	eg. use tokens to id request or CORS
Injections
	inject client side script 
	eg. XSS injection, SQL injection, XPath injection OS command injection, LDAP injection
Sensitive data exposure
	expose sensitive data directly in configuration and/or logs
	ie. should use vaults/encryption instead
Lack of method access control
	must apply authorization at every layer (controller, service. dao)
Using dependencies with known vunerabilities
	double check vunerabilities in libraries being used
