# workspace-simple-mvc

Directory containing the react16 UI in subdirectory "simple-mvc-ui" and the spring-framework application that provides the REST APIs in the "simple-mvc-api" subdirectory.  This forms the basis of the simple-mvc demo application.

See each subdirectory for the README.md file describing its role in the demo.
